# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
  *This analysis' purpose was to find all of the retiring employees in different departments so that decisions could be made for future hiring purposes. Also, management wanted mentors for the next group of employees being hired so a table was compiled of all eligible mentorship employees. Lastly, the retirees were broken down by job title and the amount of people with each job title retiring was sorted. 
  
## Results
 * There is an enormous amount of employees about to retire accross all departments in the company. Serious work will need to be done to get the next group of employees up to speed
 * The Senior engineering and staff positions are the highest amount of retirees by position. A lot of promotions will need to happen to fill these senior/leadership roles
 * There are a lot of eligible mentors. A further analysis will need to be done to determine who will take over these mentor roles. 
 * Given that most of the retirees are in their 60's, the decision will have to be made to either hire people of older age or younger age. The younger aged people could pay off in the long run because they will be with the company longer and gain insightful experience along the way.

## Summary
  * There will need to be a total of 90398 roles that need to be filled once the silver tsunami begins to make impact. I discovered this by counting the unique id's in the retirement
  * There 1549 mentorship eligible employees which is not enough supply for the demand of the silver tsunami. Outside help will be needed when the new hires get onboarded into the company. 
  * An additional query that I performed was the breakdown of the total amount of salary lost by each job title. This breakdown helps show how much overhead the company will get back and potentially how much money to invest in each department/role. For example, the Senior Staff positions made the most salary so perhaps the most money will go into these jobs to recruit new candidates.

  * A second query that I performed was grouping the amount of people retiring from each department. This would allow management to get a more comprehensive look at how this silver tsunami will shake up the company. With this information, management can make better decisions about where funding is allocated and which departments will need more mentorship.
